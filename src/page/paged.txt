Since the orientation is perfectly horizontal, the first step is to determine the position and extent of the
lines of text in the image. This can be done by constructing a horizontal projection and searching it
for minima. The projection is simply the sum of the pixel values in a specified direction, so a horizon-
tal projection is the sum of the pixels in each row. The row of pixels that begins a new line will be one
in which some of the pixels are black, and the last row belonging to that line will be the last one hav-
ing any black pixels. The start and end columns for the line are found by searching the rows that
belong to that line, from column zero through to the first column having a set pixel. The same is done,
but in the reverse direction, to find the last set pixel in a line.
